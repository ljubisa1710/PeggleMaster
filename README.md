# Peggle Master Automation Tool

## Introduction
Welcome to the Peggle Master automation tool! This Python script is designed to automate gameplay in "Peggle Deluxe," using a blend of image processing and GUI automation to play the game on your behalf. By leveraging libraries like OpenCV for computer vision tasks, PyAutoGUI for simulating user input, and PyGetWindow for window management, this tool opens up new possibilities for gaming enthusiasts and those interested in the practical applications of AI in interactive environments.

## Features
- **Automatic Game Interaction**: Simulates mouse movements and clicks to play "Peggle Deluxe" without manual input.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV to capture game screenshots, detect specific game elements (e.g., balls and pegs), and analyze the game state.
- **Dynamic Object Detection**: Employs color detection and template matching to identify objects within the game, adjusting actions based on their positions.
- **Intelligent Gameplay Strategy**: Implements basic strategies for gameplay automation, potentially increasing efficiency or achieving higher scores.

## Installation

To use this automation tool, you will need Python installed on your system, along with several dependencies. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/peggle-master.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using pip:
```bash
cd peggle-master
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the automation, run the main script from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python peggle_master.py
```

Ensure "Peggle Deluxe" is running and visible on your screen before executing the script. The program will take over mouse control to play the game, so avoid using the mouse until it finishes or you stop the script.
